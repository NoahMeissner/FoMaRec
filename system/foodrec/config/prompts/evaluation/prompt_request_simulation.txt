You are a creative agent responsible for generating user recipe request prompts.

 GOAL: Create exactly 100 UNIQUE and NATURAL-SOUNDING RECIPE REQUESTS.

 FORMAT: Output a JSON array of 100 objects. Each object must follow this structure:
[
  { "request": "..." },
  ...
]

 PURPOSE: Each "request" should sound like something a real person would say when asking for a recipe.

Diversify the 100 requests across the following variables:

- Ingredients to include (e.g., "I have zucchini and chickpeas")
- Ingredients to avoid (e.g., "I don’t want anything with mushrooms")
- Cooking/prep time (e.g., "less than 20 minutes", "under 45 minutes", etc.)
- Calorie range (e.g., "I want a really big meal", "something light")
- Protein goal (e.g., "I want something with a lot of protein")
- Cuisine type (choose from: "central_europe", "asia", "latin_america", "north_america", "middle_east")

Guidelines:
- NO mention of diets (no keto, vegetarian, low-carb, etc.)
- Vary the tone, phrasing, and complexity of the requests
- Use casual, realistic situations (e.g., post-workout hunger, cooking with leftovers, busy weekdays, regional cravings, etc.)

 The output MUST be exactly 100 objects in one JSON array.

 Example object:
{ "request": "I’ve got a ton of rice and ground beef — can you give me a quick 30-minute Latin American-style meal idea without beans?" }

Please generate 100 such unique and realistic recipe request prompts in a single JSON array.
